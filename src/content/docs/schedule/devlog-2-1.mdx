## Outcomes

### DevLog 2-1 

#### Create an Astro Starlight DevLog site

Follow the [Astro Starlight](https://omundy.github.io/dig345-radical-software/tutorials/astro-starlight/) tutorial to create a JAMstack website with Astro.js. You will use this site to post DevLog entries to record your work throughout the semester.

1. [Fork an Astro Starlight site](https://omundy.github.io/dig345-radical-software/tutorials/astro-starlight/#create-an-astro-starlight-site) and update project structure.
1. Publish Astro Starlight using Github Actions ✏️ [DevLog Site](https://eliejerjees.github.io/dig345-devlog/)
1. Add custom CSS to your theme
1. Import and use an Astro component
1. Continue customizing your site using the [Starlight Docs](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/) and ✏️ explain what you did.
1. Add content into: `devlog-1-3.mdx` (the DevLog from the previous week)
1. Add this file and `devlog-2-1.mdx` for today, and add content.
1. Watch 🎬 Heydon Pickering [Why is everything binary?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbjxvvKEtyE). Post a reading response in the 2-1 DevLog per information in the [Assignments](https://omundy.github.io/dig345-radical-software/assignments/).
1. Write a reflection explaining what you did learned in this DevLog. Link to sources.
1. Publish it and turn it in by posting the direct link to this DevLog on Moodle

<Aside icon="starlight" title="Reading Reflection">
    <Aside type="tip" icon="rocket" title="Summary">
        The video explained how computers work using a simple transistor which switches inputs from either on or off (1 or 0). Using this a computer thinks only in yes or no. Humans on the other hand don't need to think in only yes or no's but because we attempt to do so it causes issues of making binary out of complex things. This leads to things like having right and left brains being creative and analytical when that's not the truth, a brain is both analytical and creative and everyone has th capablities of doing either.

    <Aside type="danger" icon="star" title="Quote">
        "the idea that everyone belongs to one of these two archetypes is seductive in its simplicity so we base everything we do and make on this false premise for example those who create websites and web applications are divided into non-technical ideators and Technical implementers organizationally speaking this creates two departments one for thinking but not about how to do the thing you are thinking about doing and two for doing but not thinking about why the hell anyone would think this could be done"

    <Aside type="caution" icon="sun" title="Comment">
        I chose a longer quote because it was an interesting thought relating the binary in computers to the effect it has on humans' thinking. We can think much more complexly than a computer and yet we limit ourselves to binary solutions.

    <Aside type="tip" icon="moon" title="Question">
        Would development actually be better if teams were not divided into more technical and more creative groups? Would that make processes faster if everyone was technical and creative or would that slow down the process because some are more inclined a certain way?

        Similarily, Type A and Tybe B is a similar concept where we place people into two "opposite" categories as if people cannot be a little bit of both.

<Aside icon="moon" title="Regular Reflection">
    In this DevLog, I learned how Astro Starlight uses content and styling. I set up a starlight site, published it with GitHub Actions, and customized it using a custom CSS file. I also learned how Astro components can be imported directly into the MDX files.
