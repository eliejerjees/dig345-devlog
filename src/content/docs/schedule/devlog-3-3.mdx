## Outcomes

### DevLog 3-3 

#### Create a full stack application using Node and Express

Create a full stack application following Chapter 9 of Critical Web Design and the [Bad Password API Node/Express](https://criticalwebdesign.github.io/wiki/chapter-09/9-4-bad-password-api/) tutorial.

1. Read 📚 Chapter 9 in Critical Web Design. ✏️ Write a reflection about the Context for this chapter.
    <Aside icon="starlight" title="Reading Reflection">
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
            The chapter explains how data tracking is built into the basic functioning of the web and how user data is constantly collected, analyzed, and used to influence behavior. It shows that this process is part of a system of surveillance capitalism where corporations profit off of predicting people's actions. The chapter argues that data collection creates power imbalances, especially when users are unaware of how much information is being gathered and used against them. The example of gambling apps demonstrates how data tracking can actively exploit vulnerable people rather than help them.

        <h4>Quote</h4>
        <p>
            "Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data." - Shoshana Zuboff
        </p>

        <h4>Comment</h4>
        <p>
            The quote at the beginning stood out to me because it clearly shows that the issue is not just data being collected, but it's that human behavior is becoming a resource to companies. The chapter clearly puts into words how online interactions are now resources that are sold off like any other physical material.
        </p>

        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>
            Is it really possible to keep your data private? Many sites that have, to a certain extent, become necessities require that your data be shared. Sites like Amazon, even Gmail/Outlook, while they are not *necessities*, it is hard to operate without them.
        </p>

        <h4>Related Piece</h4>
        <p>
            Spotify Wrapped is a good example of this. The entirety of Spotify Wrapped is just data visualization. They display your data in a way that makes it interesting for you to see and share with others, but at the end of the day they just have all your favorite preferences saved in databases. They recommend concert tickets of your favorite artists when they come to your city. They recommend new music based off of what you usually like. They know when you listen to music most and least and work based off of that.
